Hello,

My name is Rosalia and I am currently a student in Software Development at Trybe teaching institution.

I decided to make a career transition in the year 2020.

I was encouraged to enter the technology area and accepted the challenge because I was always very connected to propose improvements in the systems of the companies I worked for, I discovered that I am passionate about technology and how much it motivates me and challenges me to seek more knowledge.

At the moment I am in Module 3 - BackEnd Development, where I will study about: Docker, SQL, Node.js, TypeScript, POO, MongoDB among others,

I am already certified in Fundamentals of the WEB and FrontEnd Development.
